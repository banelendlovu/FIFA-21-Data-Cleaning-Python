# FIFA-21-Data-Cleaning-Python
Welcome to the FIFA 21 Data Cleaning project – where I meticulously transformed raw soccer player data into a polished and consistent dataset using the power of Python on Jupyter Notebook. Dive into the details of the data cleaning process below:

## Dataset Overview:
The dataset was initially housed in a CSV file and underwent a thorough cleaning process to enhance its quality and coherence.

## Key Transformations:
1. Club: Eliminated pesky line spaces for a streamlined Club column
2. Contract: Resolved inconsistencies in date formats, ensuring a standardized representation
3. Height and Weight: Achieved uniformity by standardizing units of measure – height in centimeters (cm) and weight in kilograms (kg)
4. W/F, SM, I/R: Stripped away non-essential characters (stars for rating) for improved clarity
5. Hits: Refined data types by converting strings and floats to integers, replacing 'nan' with None for a cleaner presentation

## Additional Insights:
To enrich the dataset and facilitate a more comprehensive analysis, I introduced the following columns:

1. Contract Start Date: Unveiled the commencement date of player contracts
2. Contract End Date: Pinpointed the conclusion date of player contracts
3. Contract Length in Years: Calculated and included the duration of each player's contract in years

Explore the intricacies of my data cleaning efforts to witness the transformation of raw FIFA 21 player data into a refined and structured dataset, setting the stage for insightful analyses.
